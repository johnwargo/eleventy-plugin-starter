# Eleventy Plugin Starter (JavaScript)

When I first started trying to figure out how to write my own Eleventy plugin, many of the articles showed how to do it, but never showed a complete project. For me, to truly understand what I had to deliver in my plugin, I had to know what the project structure looked like. Once I had that, the rest of the work was just writing the JavaScript code for the plugin. 

This repository contains a complete Eleventy plugin as well as a complete Eleventy site that exercises the plugin,.
